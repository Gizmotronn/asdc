# 5.1
5.1 Describe uses of automation for construction. Show appropriate automation systems to assist with transportation and delivery of materials and equipment, assembly of the settlement, installing utilities and infrastructure, and interior finishing. Describe how humans monitor automated construction processes and progress, and where/how human interaction is required during construction. Show how jigs hold robots in position to perform construction tasks in zero g.

Space Transportation Systems (STS) can be used as systems (architectures/infrastructures) that deliver payloads and people over large distances. It is a proposed system of reusable, manned vehicles. 

Benefits of the STS: 
	• Can reduce costing by replacing the current method of launching capsules on expendable shuttles with reusable spacecraft. 
	• Supports follow-on programs (including permanent orbiting space stations – VERY GOOD)


Construction
	• The external repair/maintenance bots (see section 5.2) can also be used for the construction of the station
	• The drones will be able to be used by an external user (see section 5.3 on private/public networks/keys)

Construction
	- Use modified "super tugs" from Grumbo to transport engineers and move materials
		○ Automated super tugs can peform some basic tasks and transport engineers
		○ Transported engineers can peform more complex tasks and repairs by going EVA from the tug
		○ Tugs will be outfitted with cameras inside and outside so that people can monitor there progress, variety of tools necessary for repairs and construction, large claw in which to manipulate materials, RCS thrusters so they will be able to precisely move around the station
		○ Tugs not equipped with RCS can be used to transfer materials from Earth or a different orbit to the station
	- Interior will be mostly done by hand by humans
	- Parts of the station can be brought up "whole" instead of having to build it there
	- Smaller tug like things can be used to build the interior? Any subcontractors with small automated machines to use for construction
	- Deliveries will be made to the Axle through transport ships 
	- In the assembly process we will start with the Axle as it will provide a foundation for future rings and as place to drop off cargo and materials 
	

 Grumbo Aerospace provides tugs
Grumbo Aerospace is one of four major business groups of Grumbo International.  The other three business areas are ground transportation products, electronics systems, and general industries.
The products of the General Industries business area include F1M8 Robots.  Although F1M8s are available for a variety of uses, they all share a proprietary "artificial intelligence" capability that enables them to recognize commands in human speech and "learn" through experience.  When the company joined SEAC, Grumbo developed F1M8s with capabilities needed to support space infrastructure development.  The company's robots were sent to the Moon to build habitats at mining sites before humans arrived; they didn't last long in the highly abrasive dust, but replacements were sent frequently to keep production going.  
The most successful products of the Electronics Systems Group are data storage systems that replaced traditional computer disks and hard drives.  These systems fit in a pocket, have no rotating parts, generate so little heat that they require no cooling, tolerate severe environments and other abuse, will not destroy data if they fail, and can be connected in groups to grow storage capacity almost indefinitely.  They enabled the evolution of personal computers to the ubiquitous “dumb boxes” into which users plug in their own “smart guts”.
The Ground Transportation Group builds vehicles customized for operation in space, with technical assistance from the Aerospace division.  Grumbo ground vehicles are used for transportation near lunar bases.  F1M8 “intelligence” in control systems of vehicles used for construction enables significant reductions in costs and schedules through autonomous operations capability.
Grumbo did some of the earliest work on a space tug concept to move satellites and cargo between orbital locations.  It intended to build the first unit for use at Space Station Freedom, and instead went into full production to meet the needs of inter-orbit transportation for SEAC infrastructure development and Alexandriat construction.  The company quickly developed "supertug" versions suitable for moving materials to lunar orbit, with capabilities to deliver mass anywhere in cis-lunar space.  Grumbo was also the first company to build an inter-orbit vehicle capable of carrying personnel to Earth-Moon L5, L4, L1, and L2.  Recent Grumbo research pioneered use of silicon buckystructure fabric to create additional habitable volumes on spacecraft and lunar facilities.
The company's most well-known product is the Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV), adapted from a design that lost a proposal in the mid-1990’s.  When SEAC infrastructure development greatly expanded the demand for launch services, Grumbo developed a mid-size RLV (25,000 lbs. payload capability to the existing spaceports, and 43,000 lbs to LEO) to transport construction crews and fragile equipment.  This 200-foot-long vehicle was also the first to be compatible with the Foundation Society’s CASSSC cargo containers now standard for all launch and space vehicles.  Subsequent RLV versions meet the needs of various niche markets for launch services.  RLV was briefly threatened by competition from the more economical Condor when it entered service two years later--until commercial operators realized that there were plenty of launch customers for fleets of both vehicles.  Grumbo also developed designs for the "Grumbo Jumbo", a heavy-lift reusable Single Stage to Orbit design (100,000 lb. payload capability), which went into production for the Alexandriat project.  This launch vehicle became the workhorse of cargo launchers to support settlement construction; its cargo launch costs are now down to $1000 per pound.
Grumbo regards space settlement construction as a corporate goal; company officials believe their work with Alexandriat puts them in a good position to win the Columbiat contract.


# 5.2
Specify automation systems for settlement business, maintenance, repair, security, and safety functions -- including for restaurants, retail, offices, hotels, agriculture (including in experiment volumes hazardous to humans), and landscaping and facilities maintenance. Show monitoring and control centre(s) to assure safety of residents, and define numbers of display and control systems required. Describe security measures to allow only authorised personnel to access critical data and command computing and robot systems. Provide automated alarms and announcement of hazards.

Security Methods
The most important jobs (monitoring of citizens, for example), will only be done from the location of the offices for those jobs.
Main Security Methods
	- Camera system
		○ Located throughout the station (although some privacy will be afforded inside homes although it may be subject to change depending on the individual's circumstances)
		○ Camera's relatively high resolution allowing the faces of individual's to be recognized by the system 
	- Biometrics (fingerprint, facial)
		○ The most common lock within the station
		○ Each individual's biometric reading will be entered into the onboard database located in the Security Centre 
		○ Better then conventional keys as it is generally faster and consumes less resources
	- Conventional key card, password, etcetera
		○ Reserved for high security, high risk areas (administration, communications hub)
		○ Will be a combination of two or more depending on the security threat posed
	- Credit Card
		○ Issued by the station upon arrival to the station
		○ Replacement for lost credit cards is a flat fee that covers the production of the card
		○ Used to pay throughout the station is connected to the individual's chosen bank account
		○ Spending can be tracked thorugh issued PDA
		○ Payment approved with a biometric reading before hand to prevent fraudulent use?
		○ PDA can be the credit card?
	
	

Minimum requirement: chart, table, or list(s) of settlement systems and parameters that must be monitored and controlled for safe and productive operations of Columbiat.

	This includes cooks, chefs, cultivators, harvesters, etc
Living Quarters	Anyone can access their own living quarters		Fingerprint/biometric lock on the doors to the living quarters
	No one can access another person's living quarters  by themselves		
			"Panic Button" that someone inside can press if there is someone outside their door that is distressing them
			
			Security Cameras - aiming at the door to see who is entering the quarters
Food & Drink 	Anyone can access restaurants and cafes		Key card swipe Biometrics instead
			
	Only employees can access the kitchen (unless we go the full automation route and employ robots)		A group of robots will be able to access the restaurants/cafes. There are 2 groups of robots that can access these. The first of these belong to the governing body, and the second of these groups belongs to the owners of the restaurants, who rent space. The robots will have a serial code (like an EMMI number) that allows them to access the restaurant.
			
	Manned by robots		Regular citizens can access the front of the restaurant, and will buy food/drink with a special card that will be linked to their bank account.
Retail 	Manned by robots and people where necessary (clothing stores and high risk/ valuable stores)	Throughout all the rings 	Like with the food and drink areas, there will be robots that organise/man the shops.  Manned exclusively by software based robots? 
	Access available to all	 possibly not through the Spire?	Products dispensed vending machine style. Clothing stores is the only store that may be manned by people to provide advice and monitor fitting

Central Security Centre
	- Where all video recordings are monitored and stored
	- Biometrics stored
	- High risk or suspect individual's are monitored
	-  Access to this center is highly restricted

Virtual/Physical Robots
Maintenance Robots
	- Maintenance robots conducting complex repairs/maintenance will have to be performed remotely. 
	- Things such as monitoring software or physical robots which check the condition of infrastructure and perform simple actions can be solely automated.
	- If an anomaly is detected in infrastructure during a maintenance check, a report will be sent back to Maintenance Centre detailing things such as where the anomaly was found, images of it if possible and where the anomaly is estimated to sit on a risk matrix ranging from  1 (negligible) to 10 (potentially catastrophic) which will effect the order in which it is presented to the receiver in the Maintenance Centre with higher listings getting priority. From there the receiver will interpret the report and decide the course of action from there such as authorizing a robot to attempt repairs or sending a human to do it.
Security Robots
	- Software monitors what content an individual is consuming, what sites they visit, etcetera. What they are viewing may be flagged by monitoring software as suspicious and put up for review by a receiver in the Security Centre or Communications hub
	- Cameras around the station will be high resolution enough that software will be able to recognize faces. If an individual is recognized as being in an unauthorized place, the footage may be flagged for review in the Secuirty Centre. 
In Home Robots
	- Integrated smart home functionality, similar to Google Home or Alexa but more advanced, while within their housing units people are able to vocally control various things within their home including temprature, music, phone calls, personal calendars, etc. An audio cue will playback to let the individual know the command has been follow received.
		○ The software will adapt to their users voice and attempt to receive commands exclusively from their user with verbal permission given by the user to allow another person to change the settings. 
		○ Settings can also be remotely controlled using the PDA.
	- Tracking the location of the PDA the home is able to determine whether the user has left their home and after a period of delay will turn off unnecessary functions to conserve power.

Glossary:
	• Mbps (megabits per second) - 1 million bits (or 1/8 million bytes) per second. Internet speed
	• ISPs - Internet service provider

Types of robots:
Health & Medical
While location (as in proximity to other humans) often has very little to do with loneliness and depression (depression is most common in people that live in incredibly busy cities. While this means that (in theory) our astronauts on board the station won't get depressed, they probably will. Work and relationship struggles will often create the seeds for depression. To deal with depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses, companion robots (androids, or droids) will be one of the types of robots that will be seen on the station. These robots will be physical, however they can also interact with a user's PDA):

PDA
The PDA will be given to all inhabitants on board the station, and will provide access to the internet, games and applications related to work, etc. It will be about the size of a modern smart phone (with biometric locks and good-quality cameras, running on Android)…..

As seen to the right, the internet won't need to much "stuff" added or changed to work in space (can someone please work on this?). As our inhabitants will be long-term residents (especially considering there are children on board), we will want to have good internet speeds. Apparently the internet speeds are 600mbps on board the ISS (which is around 6 times the maximum speed in Australia, so really fast), however we probably won't need speeds that fast. Even 50-100 mbps (megabits per second) will work fine for streaming video. 

(Will phone - as in calling and texting as we do on Earth using sms - work in space?). A large reason why residents will get a PDA is for work. There will be a number of jobs that will be required on board the station, and these include teaching, maintenance, etc. The PDA will have an area (on the homescreen, see image below) for work-related applications that will require an additional password to get into (see security). These apps will vary based on the occupation of the user.


Note: this image is from an iOS folder, expect it to look more like how it would look on Android, but another good example would be the Cydia tweak "Boxy" (note: jailbroken iOS device needed). The work-related apps would be on a regular homescreen, but they would be compressed like this. No folder background is needed

See the JOBS section below for more on this part of the PDA
See community section -> to the right of this section

Smart watches will also be used

Security
Much like Samsung Knox's "Secure Folder" (see https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/mobile-devices/what-is-the-secure-folder-and-how-do-i-use-it/), the applications for a user's occupation will be locked down inside the phone - which means, even if the phone is locked, the user will still have to input a password to unlock the apps. If the phone has just been turned on, you will have to enter a password both to unlock the phone and to unlock the work part of the phone - no biometrics (iris, face, eyeball, fingerprint, palm, voice, hair, blood - basically anything that contains DNA, but probably not blood, hair, saliva, or….better not finish that sentence actually). Once the phone has been unlocked after being turned on (basically it has been decrypted, if the phone has not been unlocked after being turned on it is 100% encrypted), biometrics can be used.

Stuff from Brisbane finals 2019
Community computing and automate home resource access through smartwatch security measures.
Smartwatches - used for security clearance, interfacing with PC and other devices, connecting to the internet, collect food, checking into & controlling workspaces.  
Automated light & door systems - lights turn on at set times, doors (public) open (proximity sensor)
Work reports and other documents sent from previous shift to smart watch
Automate domestic services (Bots4U)
Climate control for general spaces are automated, controlling humidity and atmosphere very precisely.


Communication Network

What we need to figure out.  Maximum range of Wi-Fi router and number of people it can handle
Modem Distance: 80m using repeaters
Number of support: 50 people per access points 
We will need 3,000 access points

Ring diameter: 1800m
Axle length: 2050m

	- Modems connected with ethernet cords to the communication hub.
	- Communication hub located on the Axle
		○ Communications hub will transmit to Earth orbiting satellite
		○ Communications hub will monitor traffic manned with humans
Work places has high internet priority over home residental use

This was from the 2019 finals, below we're going to refine it for this RFT.

2019 Finals


Communication
Internet
As we will be close to the Earth, the internet will be quick and easy to use. If we were communicating from mars or beyond, that would be a different story. The speed of electromagnetic waves to the city will be around about 1 second or less, so bytes will be sent and received quickly. However, like on the ISS, the internet speeds (in terms of megabits/kilobits per second) will be slowed unless a "booster" or modem-like device is created. According to the second reference listed, the internet was at dial-up speeds back in 2015.

Okay, apparently I was incorrect. The maximum bandwidth on the ISS (as of December 2016 according to Techcrunch) is 300 mbps, which is faster than most ISPs. Apparently when the internet speed/capacity was increased (doubled), it was mostly due to terrestrial changes rather than the creation of new infrastructure or whatever on the ISS.

According to space.com (2010), NASA increased the speed of space communications (to probes and rovers) by fusing 3 aged communication networks into 1 single, more efficient network, improving communication speeds by up to 50 times. Note: this doesn't increase how fast the signal arrives from the probe to Earth (or vice-versa), however it increases how fast messages can be coded and decoded (as well as increasing file size to accommodate large photos and even videos). 
The original networks had not had an upgrade since 1990. Previously, NASA created networks based on the requirements of each specific mission, however now (after 2010?) the network was updated to be unified and to work with all missions.

Communications Hub
A primary communications hub will be the central point where all communications flow though, including drone feeds, personal comms, and broadcasts. There will be several small, omnidirectional antenna for receiving drone feeds, then larger dishes for pointing at Earth and the Moon. All antenna will have equal copies, for redundancy, and the directed dishes will be sunk into recesses to help prevent impacts. The antenna will be attached in various locations along the non-rotating part of the station. The hub will be highly restricted because any comms can be seen from there.
(This was from the 2019 finals - apart from bold text)
	• The communications hub is used to send messages, track space debris, connect to the internet and control parts of the station
	• Messages can only be seen by people in the message (group message or two-person message)
	• All browsing data is sent to a cache (to access this cache you have to have the proper security clearance). Browsing data is saved for security purposes
	• Cloud, common network, authentication via smartwatch - or biometrics
	• Once in your room or private space, you will be able to use the functionality of your smartwatch or your PDA

Okay in order to cover the ring cylinder areas alone with wifi we will need 216 modems per ring:
	Firstly we look at a cross section of the ring and the support provided by one ring
	
	Then we calculate the angle of support provided by that: roughly = 10 degrees
	
	Divide 360/10 = 36
	Multiply by how many layers we will need per ring: 450/80=6
	6*36=216

#5.4
Provide automation for port and cargo operations, with human monitoring. Show systems / vehicles to unload and load CASSSCs on visiting ships, move / store / track goods in warehouses and other logistics inventory, transport passengers, and deliver goods to / from and between businesses and homes. Define which systems are autonomous, teleoperated, and otherwise.

Minimum requirement: show automation system(s) for warehouse and logistics operations.

Cargo is taken through the skin of the axis through cargo shafts, very small tunnels

Commerce and Financial Sector
	- Responsible with:
		○ Issuing credit cards
		○ Monitoring transactions
		○ Recording what is imported and exported
		○ Track the ships that pass through and determine (refueling) and tax for using the port
		○ Schedule when ships may dock with station and for how long
		○ Manage the selling of land on the station for both residential and commercial
		○ Make sure that the taxes being paid is enough to maintain the station, the surplus being reinvested into improving the station

- Automation in Port and Cargo Operations While a ship is planning to stop at the station for any reason (stop over to refuel, trade, tourism) they need to send before hand a declaration stating among other things their intent, approximate time of arrival and general ship design to be approved by the Commerce and Financial Sector. The design of the ship must comply with regulations set by the station so that it would be compatible with the ports. Their approximate time of arrival is important in order to schedule when they are to arrive and depart in order to streamline operations and lower the chance of collisions. Ship design is important as it allows our engineers to calibrate the robots involved in the docking process towards that specific ship design (such as where does the fuel go? Or where does the cargo come out from?). Over time as models in ships become more standardized, presets will be established which will quicken this process.

Docking
	- Due to how large the space is within the ring, ships how all sizes will be able to freely move within it. 
	- The ship will line up over it's designated dock then a grabber arm similar to the one employed by the ISS will activate bringing the ship into alignment.
	- The docking outlets of both ship and station will line up and attach acting as both an anchor and a passage through which cargo and passengers may travel through. 
Unloading/ loading
	- Docking outlets will vary in size depending on their expected use. Passenger dedicated outlets will be smaller approximately 2 meters in diameter
	- During the loading/unloading phase the ship is being refueled which can be automated
Departing
	- Assumedly the system that guides the ship into docking will also be able to do it in reverse
Human monitoring of the Automation
	- Offices along "The Skin" looking into the Axle are reserved for dock engineers who are able to monitor physically through the glass or thorugh a camera system dotted around the Axle focusing on key phases (such as the hand over point from moving clamps to dock clamps, or during refueling) 
	- An emergency button will bring all operations to a stop if an engineer determines something is going wrong. 
	- Engineers may be able to go EVA in order to resolve the problem or remotely operate a machine if the issue is significant. 
	- For delicate tasks deemed risky by the engineers, they may be able to take remote control of machines through a dual joystick system or keyed in input.
